## Inspiration

In the past few months (Dec 2023), I've been diving into creating my first portfolio website using React JS, skipping the use of CSS or UI libraries. Now, it's time to amp up my online presence. Following the tech stack from my ongoing software engineering gig, I've picked Next.js and Tailwind CSS as the base for this upgraded version.

I'm stoked about adding a dark mode, a feature I haven't played with before. Using Shadcn UI should make the implementation smooth and enjoyable.

To boost my skills, I've thrown TypeScript into the mix, aiming to make the codebase clearer and more maintainable. It's all about embracing versatile and sturdy tech in the ever-changing world of web development.

Adding a contact section with EmailJS for email stuff on a static site turned out to be a breeze. And tossing in the Framer Motion library effortlessly spiced up the animations without going overboard on code. This journey was a blast, exploring new libraries and learning along the way.

## What this does?

This is a personalized website to showcase my creative work apart from my university work.
